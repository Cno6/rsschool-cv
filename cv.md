## About me

I am a final year MTUCI student. I have been learning to be a Front-end Developer for a few months. I am interested in this direction, because I like the combination of programming and design. 

In my free time I read literature of different nature. I study blockchain technology.  I plan to write useful web-application on the blockchain.

Also in the future I want to learn PWA technology and write web applications in Electron framework to create my own comprehensive productivity application.
